Step 1 - Load our csv file containing our dataset. <br>
Step 2 - Store the independent variables in X and dependent variables in y.<br>
Step 3 - Split dataset into training and testing set.<br>
Step 4 - Apply feature scaling to our independent variables.<br><br>

Note - Feature Scaling is applied so that an independent variable of higher value does not dominate while predicting the value of dependent variable.
