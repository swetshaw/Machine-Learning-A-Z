Step 1 - Load our csv file containing our dataset.
Step 2 - Store the independent variables in X and dependent variables in y.
Step 3 - Split dataset into training and testing set.
Step 4 - Apply feature scaling to our independent variables.

Note - Feature Scaling is applied so that an independent variable of higher value does not dominate while predicting the value of dependent variable.
